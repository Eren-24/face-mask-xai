# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection with Explainable AI (xAI)

ðŸ§  **Goal:**  
Build a lightweight computer vision model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask, and explain *how* the model makes its decisions using Grad-CAM and saliency maps.

ðŸ“… **Deadline:** *20 July 2025*  
ðŸ‘¥ **Team:** Group of 4 students (beginner project)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Task:** Classify images as *masked* or *unmasked*
- **Dataset:** RMFD (Real-World Masked Face Dataset) or similar
- **Model:** Lightweight CNN or MobileNetV2
- **Explainability:** Grad-CAM and saliency maps to visualize important regions
- **Error Analysis:** Analyze incorrect predictions to understand failure cases
