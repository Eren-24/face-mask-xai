# face-mask-xai
Goal: Build a lightweight deep learning model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask, and use explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM, saliency maps) to visualize what the model “sees” when making predictions.

Project deadline: 20 July 2025


Objective
 • Train a lightweight CNN (e.g., MobileNetV2) to classify images as “Mask” vs “No Mask”
 • Use explainability tools (Grad-CAM, saliency maps) to visualize and understand which facial regions the model uses for its decision
 • Analyze correct and incorrect predictions to identify failure modes and biases


Tech Stack
	•	Python: main language
	•	TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch)
	•	Grad-CAM / tf-explain / TorchCAM: explainability
	•	Matplotlib / OpenCV: visualization
	•	Streamlit / Gradio (optional): demo
	•	Google Colab / local CPU: training
